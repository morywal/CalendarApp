# AI-Powered Calendar App Requirements

## Core Features

1. **Schedule Input**
   - Allow users to input fixed schedule items (work, school, gym, sleep, etc.)
   - Support for recurring events (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Ability to specify time blocks with start and end times
   - Option to set priority levels for fixed schedule items

2. **Task Management**
   - Add new tasks with descriptions, deadlines, and estimated durations
   - Support for task dependencies (tasks that must be completed before others)
   - Ability to mark tasks as completed
   - Option to categorize tasks (work, personal, study, etc.)

3. **Intelligent Scheduling**
   - Automatically identify available time blocks around fixed schedule
   - Suggest optimal times for completing tasks based on:
     - Task duration
     - Task priority
     - Proximity to deadlines
     - User productivity patterns (if available)
   - Respect user-defined constraints (e.g., no work after 8 PM)
   - Adapt schedule when new tasks or fixed events are added

4. **Duration Estimation**
   - Allow users to manually input estimated task duration
   - Optionally suggest duration based on task type and description
   - Learn from past task completion times to improve future estimates
   - Account for buffer time between tasks

5. **User Interface**
   - Calendar view showing fixed schedule and suggested task blocks
   - Easy drag-and-drop rescheduling
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Visual distinction between fixed schedule and flexible tasks
   - Daily, weekly, and monthly views

## Technical Requirements

1. **Frontend**
   - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
   - Responsive framework (Bootstrap or similar)
   - Interactive calendar library (FullCalendar.js or similar)
   - Modern UI/UX design principles

2. **Backend**
   - Python with Flask/Django framework
   - RESTful API architecture
   - Scheduling algorithm implementation
   - Data persistence

3. **Database**
   - Store user schedules, tasks, and preferences
   - Support for recurring event patterns
   - Efficient querying for available time slots

4. **Deployment**
   - Web-based application accessible via browser
   - Potential for future mobile app integration

## User Stories

1. As a student, I want to input my class schedule and work hours so that the app knows when I'm unavailable.
2. As a busy professional, I want to add a new task with a deadline and have the app suggest the best time to work on it.
3. As a user, I want to specify how long I think a task will take so the app can allocate appropriate time.
4. As a user, I want the app to automatically adjust my schedule when I add new fixed commitments.
5. As a user, I want to see a visual representation of my day/week with both fixed events and suggested task blocks.
6. As a user, I want the app to respect my preferences (like not scheduling work late at night).
7. As a user, I want to be able to manually override suggested times if they don't work for me.
8. As a student, I want the app to help me break down large assignments into smaller tasks and schedule them appropriately.

## Constraints and Considerations

1. **Privacy**: All schedule data should be stored securely
2. **Usability**: Interface should be intuitive and require minimal training
3. **Performance**: Scheduling algorithm should be efficient and provide quick suggestions
4. **Flexibility**: System should adapt to changing schedules and priorities
5. **Accessibility**: Design should follow accessibility best practices
